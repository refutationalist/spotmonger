  * pick a safer/saner way to handle
    - cart/tar file handling
	- mplayer location
	- config file location
  * Add "multicart" with card files?
    - the idea being that we can include a group of breaks with relative cueing time.
  * Pause the cue clock
  * "soundboard mode" for playing clips faster during shows
  * some sanity checking in the config file
  * external queueing (http server, I assume)
