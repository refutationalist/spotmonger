  * figure out the zero sched bug
  * "soundboard mode" for playing clips faster during shows
  PENDING PUSH * Pause the cue clock
  * external control (http server, I assume)
  * verify licensing of included code and fonts (have a quick look before)
  * pick a safer/saner way to handle
    - cart/tar file handling
	- mplayer location
	- config file location
  * some sanity checking in the config file
  * consider using one of the mplayer node modules that have been written since spotmonger
  * Add "multicart" with card files?
    - the idea being that we can include a group of breaks with relative cueing time.
  * post-jQuery optimization (querySelector to getElementById where approp)
